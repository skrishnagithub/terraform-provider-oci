### Breaking changes
- ``LaunchDbSystemDetails`` is renamed to ``LaunchDbSystemBase`` and the type changed from struct to interface in ``LaunchDbSystemRequest``. Here is sample code that shows how to update your code to incorporate this change. 

    - Before

    ```golang
    // create a LaunchDbSystemRequest
    // There were two ways to initialize the LaunchDbSystemRequest struct.
    // This breaking change only impact option #2
    request := database.LaunchDbSystemRequest{}

    // #1. explicity create LaunchDbSystemDetails struct (No impact)
    details := database.LaunchDbSystemDetails{}
    details.AvailabilityDomain = common.String(validAD())
    details.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ... other properties
    request.LaunchDbSystemDetails = details

    // #2. use anonymous fields (Will break)
    request.AvailabilityDomain = common.String(validAD())
    request.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ...
    ```

    - After

    ```golang
    // create a LaunchDbSystemRequest
    request := database.LaunchDbSystemRequest{}
    details := database.LaunchDbSystemDetails{}
    details.AvailabilityDomain = common.String(validAD())
    details.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ... other properties

    // set the details to LaunchDbSystemBase
    request.LaunchDbSystemBase = details
    // ...
    ```
